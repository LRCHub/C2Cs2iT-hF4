Bones! Bones! Bones! Bones!
We're carrying a skeleton to an icy lake.
We're carrying so carefully, he's never gonna break.
We're carrying a skeleton to an icy lake.
And his name is Mr. Bones. Bones! Bones! Bones!
Mr. Bones. Mr. Bones. He's heavier than stone.
We heave him on our shoulders without a single moan.
We heave him on our shoulders and we he heave him on our backs.
And his name is Mr. Bones. Bones! Bones! Bones!
