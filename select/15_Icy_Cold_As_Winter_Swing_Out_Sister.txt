Holding hands with summer
Gentle as a breeze
Fragrant as your petals
Cast their spell and leave

Someone was to blame
No one knew your name

Drifting into autumn
Brush away your tears
Shadows spread their sadness
Stole away her years

Someone was to blame
No one knew your name

(Icy cold as winter)
(Icy cold as winter)
(Icy cold as winter)

Chills your empty heart
Buried with the flowers
Frozen in the dark

Empty as a garden in the summertime
Captured by the falling rain
Now the playgrounds standing still are empty
No one else comes out to play
Warm spring that never came
I never even knew your name
Fill me with completeness
Fill me with your sweetness
Now the sun has gone
Everyone's gone home
No one else comes out to play
