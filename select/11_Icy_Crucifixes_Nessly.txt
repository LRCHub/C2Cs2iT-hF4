Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

My soda help me dream
Every once in a blue moon
I promise I'm going clean
God, bring me a queen
Lord, only you know how much she would mean to me
Hundreds give me self esteem
Count me out, I'm countin' up, I'm still the same me
I don't know what more I need
Expect for the ones that I love to believe in me (Mwah), yeah

Sometimes I wake up out my sleep and I know I'm drippin'
I was reachin' for your body, this shit feel real different
Look up at the stars and I know that somebody listenin'
I found value in my purse, I iced my crucifixes
Every game comes at a loss
Insane, I feel exhausted
Every stain can't be washed
They say they love me a lot, want everything I got
Like a lab diamond, it won't happen on my watch

(I found value in my purse, I iced my crucifixes
Iced my crucifixes, iced my crucifixes
I found value in my purse, I iced my crucifixes
Iced my crucifixes, iced my crucifixes

My soda help me dream
Every once in a blue moon
I promise I'm going clean
God, bring me a queen
Lord, only you know how much she would mean to me
Hundreds give me self esteem
Count me out, I'm countin' up, I'm still the same me
I don't know what more I need
Expect for the ones that I love to believe in me (Mwah), yeah
